= Qusion Test Harness
This is just a simple rails app that I use to test Qusion[http://github.com/danielsdeleo/qusion] with Thin, Mongrel and Phusion Passenger. It doesn't use a database, and has only one controller with one action. All it actually does is create a random number and publish it as a hex string to a queue named "qusion" and then show the number in the generated page.
